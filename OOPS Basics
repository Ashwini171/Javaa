Object-Oriented Programming:
-object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only.
-The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime. 
Object:
-All objects get memory in Heap memory area
-means a real-world entity
-it has state and behavior.
-instance of a class
-ways to create objects: By reference variable(  Student s1=new Student();  ), By method and By constructor
Class:
-Collection of objects.

#Constructor:
-It is called when an instance of the class is created.
-At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
-Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
-There are two types of constructors in Java: no-arg constructor, and parameterized constructor.
-Its name must be the same as its class name
-It must have no explicit return type
-It cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized.
-There are many ways to copy the values of one object into another in Java. They are:
#Copy Constructor
Ways to create copy constructor:
-By constructor
-By assigning the values of one object into another
-By clone() method of Object class
