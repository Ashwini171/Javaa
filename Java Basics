Types of Variables :
1.local variable
2.instance variable
3.static variable

Local variables: 
-declared inside the body of the method 
-Local var can not be static.
Instance variable:
-declare inside the class but outside the method.
-not declare as static.
-instance specific so that it can not be shared with other instanaces.
Static varibale:
-create single copy and shared among the all.
-use to declare common things.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Data Types:
1. primitive :boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
2. Non Primitive: Class, interfaces, arrays.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Control Statements:
1.Decision Making statements
-if statements
-switch statement
2.Loop statements
-do while loop
-while loop
-for loop
-for-each loop
3.Jump statements
-break statement
-continue statement

#if statement:
-Simple if statement
-if-else statement
-if-else-if ladder
-Nested if-statement

#Loop statements: used to execute the set of instructions in a repeated order
#for loop:
-for(initialization, condition, increment/decrement) {    
//block of statements    
}    
#for each loop:
-don't need to update the loop variable.
-for(data_type var : array_name/collection_name){    
//statements    
}
#while loop
-if we don't know the number of iterations in advance, it is recommended to use a while loop.
#do while loop:
-When the number of iteration is not known and we have to execute the loop at least once.

#break : used to break the current flow of the program and transfer the control to the next statement outside a loop or switch statement.
#continue: doesn't break the loop, whereas, it skips the specific part of the loop and jumps to the next iteration of the loop immediately.
